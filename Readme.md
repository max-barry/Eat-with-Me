## Why I made this

I live in London. A lot of my friends don't. When they go "hey where do you like to eat around London", I have a lot of ideas so I tell them with passion. But no one remembers the names of places someone tells them. I'd love if I could just send them a link to what I like after we talk.

So that's what this will be. When I get a chance to finish it.

p.s. incase you're wondering, I like drinking milkshakes at The Original Dinerant in Portland, Oregon, I think Okon and The Joint in Brixton Arcade in London rock, and if you're fancy then Scalini in Chelsea in West London whips.
